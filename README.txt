This mod completely overhauls the final boss, Mordred. The reasoning behind such is backed by a number of common complaints about him:
1) The amount of randomness behind his planeshift is substantially higher than that of the rest of the game. This is especially jarring because the rest of the game emphasizes carefully observing the enemies and terrain in upcoming rifts to see whether your build is prepared to handle them, and landing in the optimal spot for an opening advantage; Mordred's planeshift completely throws that aspect of the game out of the window.
2) Since you don't get a preview of what enemies are now present whenever Mordred planeshifts, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to judge the threat level of the current realm. He could have planeshifted in an incredibly dangerous enemy capable of affecting the whole realm, e.g. the Time Keeper, which can easily catch you off-guard unless you meticulously examine every single tile after every planeshift.
3) Since Mordred planeshifts the whole realm at once, there's a very high chance that your minions will be shifted away. On spammy minion builds this isn't a big deal, but it's unnecessarily punishing for builds that use a small number of powerful minions.
4) Mordred himself isn't too threatening, except for his melee attack that's capable of often killing you instantly. Making sure to stay out of his melee range is all well and good, but certain effects can randomly teleport him next to you or vice versa, resulting in a very sudden and unceremonious death.

To address issues 1 to 3 above, this mod changes Mordred's planeshift to only affect an area of radius 4 around himself, but it generates four times the usual amount of monsters. His needlessly annoying Void Tango spell is gone, replaced by teleporting near you combined with the aforementioned limited-radius planeshift. This should make it much easier to recognize and predict the impact of each planeshift he performs, and make it less likely for your minions to be erased.

To address issue 4, and to make the final battle more exciting in general, Mordred himself now has completely different spells:
- Rift Wizardry: 4 radius; 13 turns cooldown. Teleport near the wizard and planeshift around self. The reworked planeshift, as above.
- Rift Beam: 2 damage; 16 range; 3 turns cooldown. Deals 3 random damage types in a beam; melts walls. Switches to a random spell after casting.
- Rift Blast: 4 damage; 10 range; 2 radius; 3 turns cooldown. Deals 3 random damage types. Switches to a random spell after casting.
- Rift Wave: 3 damage; 12 range; 3 turns cooldown. Deals 3 random damage types in a cone. Switches to a random spell after casting.
Out of the last three spells, he'll only have one at a time, but switch to a random one after each cast.
Moreover, all of Mordred's spells that have the relevant stats will gain +1 base damage, range, and radius for each reincarnation he loses. As a result, he'll become substantially more dangerous as the fight progresses.

Finally, since the initial layout of realm 25 is no longer immediately planeshifted away by Mordred wholesale, the enemy spawns on this level are now comparable to previous levels, and the most powerful types of regular endgame enemies that otherwise do not have gates can have them in this final level, e.g. glass butterflies and gold skulls. Whenever Mordred planeshifts, he will now always generate the new level according to these parameters.

Game balance is an extremely finicky thing, so please let me know if any of these changes are too easy or too hard; I'll make adjustments accordingly.
